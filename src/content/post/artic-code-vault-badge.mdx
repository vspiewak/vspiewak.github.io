I just received an **Artic Code Vault Contributor** badge on [Github](https://github.com/vspiewak?tab=achievements) üèÖ ü•≥

Some of my commits will be stored 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain, thanks to my contributions to these projects :
* [elastic/logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash)
* [mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber)
* [spring-attic/spring-security-oauth](https://github.com/spring-attic/spring-security-oauth)

GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020, consisting of 21TB of data, and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault.

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA),
a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.

AWA is devoted to archival storage in perpetuity. The film reels are stored in a steel-walled container inside a sealed chamber within a decommissioned coal mine on the remote archipelago of Svalbard. The AWA already preserves historical and cultural data from Italy, Brazil, Norway, the Vatican, and many others.

At least I will have something to brag about at the Christmas dinner this year üòÑ
