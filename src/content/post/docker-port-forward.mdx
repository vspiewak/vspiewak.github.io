Ever felt jealous of Kubernetes `kubectl port-forward` command while you're wrestling with Docker ?

I just crafted a tiny shell script that lets you forward local ports to your Docker containers faster than you can say "Why isn't this already a Docker feature?"

Let's be honest, it was just a pretext to craft a one-liner install script in Bash 😏

You can give it a try :
```bash 
# install
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vspiewak/dpf/master/install.sh | bash

# then
dpf <container-name> <local-port> <container-port>

# or simpler
dpf <container-name> <port>
```
